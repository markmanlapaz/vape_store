SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER
=====================

WordPress requires a screenshot.png file at 1200x900 pixels in the theme root.

To create one:
1. Take a screenshot of your finished homepage at 1200x900
2. Save it as screenshot.png in this folder
3. Delete this .txt file

Alternatively, use any image editor to create a 1200x900 branded image.
